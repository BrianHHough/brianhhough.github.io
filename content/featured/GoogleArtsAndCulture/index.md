In a partnership between the Harvard Kennedy School's Project on American Indian Economic Development [(HPAIED)](https://hpaied.org/) and [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/), I helped with building digital, 3D, and virtually-immersive exhibits on Google's platform. The exhibits covered topics from government performance to community/economic development and serve as a toolkit for global government best practices.
