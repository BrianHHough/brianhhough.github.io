FlightSurety is a decentralized application on flight delay insurance for passengers with oracles provide flight status information for the contract. It's managed as a collaboration between airlines, giving passenters the ability to purchase insurance prior to a flight. If the flight is delayed because of the airline, the passengers are paid 1.5X the amount they paid for the insurance.
