`#ScreentimeBU2019` is the yearly, peer-reviewed conference organized by the Emerging Media Studies graduate program of Boston University's College of Communication. The theme of this year's conference was the "Borderless World: Redefining Human Connections." My research presentation focused around a content analysis of 2018 Congressional websites and the dialogic loops of communication that are and are not utilized across 44 variables spanning 5 quantifiable constructs.
