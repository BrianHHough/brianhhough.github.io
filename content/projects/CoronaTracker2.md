CoronaTracker is a progressive web application that lets users monitor and track their COVID-19 symptoms and health information while learning about the virus. The daily symptom tracker has both quantiative and qualitiative questions, and a flashcards section provides quick ways to learn about COVID. The app was featured in Decrypt, Innovative@BU, and more.
