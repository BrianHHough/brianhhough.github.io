In a partnership between the Harvard Kennedy School's Project on American Indian Economic Development (HPAIED) and Google Arts & Culture, I helped with building digital, 3D, and virtually-immersive exhibits on Google's platform. The exhibits covered topics from government performance to community/economic development and serve as a toolkit for global government best practices.
